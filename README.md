# RANDOM-THE-GAME
This is a basic console application for Windows which I have coded in C++. It is a game of random numbers.
Its just a basic game of Random Numbers in which there is 10 rounds and in each round you have 5 chances to predict the system generated number.
This application is console based application, which is capable to run on windows only.
